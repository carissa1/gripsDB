<h1 class='mb-4'><strong>FP</strong>base</h1>

<h3><strong>A database for users of fluorescent proteins</strong></h3>

<p>FPbase is designed to be a source of information for people using fluorescent proteins in their research (such as in fluorescence microscopy).  It is not (at least intially) designed to be a comprehensive source of information about all fluorescent proteins ever developed.  However, we welcome additions and suggestions!  If there is an aspect of fluorescent proteins that you think should be represented here, let us know!</p>

<h3><strong>How to use this site</strong></h3>

<h5><strong>Search</strong></h5>
There are many ways to find and compare fluorescent proteins on this site.  Of course, you can always just type the name of the protein you're looking for into the search box on the home page or the top right corner of this page.  To perform more complicated searches, use the <a href="{% url 'proteins:search' %}">advanced query builder</a>, where you can search using a number of fields (e.g. Name, Sequence, EC, QY, Spectra, Oligomerization, Year Published, etc...) and a variety of operators (e.g. contains, greater than, etc...).
