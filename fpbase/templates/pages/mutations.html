mutations.html notes

how is this stored in the database?
===================================
every node in the lineage has a parent and mutation...
the mutation is stored as a mutation string *with positions relative to the parent*
technically this is duplicated information, since the sequences are also stored in the database... but it allows for parallel confirmation/checking

neutral mutations
